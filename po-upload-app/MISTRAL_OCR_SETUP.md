# Mistral OCR Setup Guide

## Implementation Complete âœ…

I've successfully implemented the Mistral OCR workflow into your PO upload application. Here's what was added:

### Features Implemented:
1. **Mistral API Integration**: Three API routes created for the OCR workflow
   - `/api/mistral/upload` - Uploads files to Mistral
   - `/api/mistral/file-url` - Gets temporary file URLs from Mistral
   - `/api/mistral/ocr` - Performs OCR on documents

2. **UI Updates**: The upload page now displays:
   - Document preview on the left
   - OCR extracted text on the right
   - Multi-page documents are separated by `<<<>>>` markers

3. **Automatic OCR Processing**: When you upload a file, it automatically:
   - Uploads to Mistral for OCR processing
   - Extracts text using Mistral's OCR model
   - Displays the markdown-formatted text alongside the preview
   - Then uploads to Supabase for storage

## Setup Instructions:

1. **Add your Mistral API Key**:
   - Open `.env.local`
   - Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual Mistral API key
   ```
   MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_actual_mistral_api_key_here
   ```

2. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Upload a document**:
   - Navigate to `/upload`
   - Select a PDF or image file
   - Click "Upload & Extract"
   - The OCR results will appear on the right side

## Notes:
- The OCR process happens before the Supabase upload
- Multi-page PDFs will have their pages separated by `<<<>>>` in the OCR output
- The extracted text is displayed in a monospace font for better readability
- Both preview and OCR results are shown side-by-side on larger screens
